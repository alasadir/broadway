# Investigating the Relationship Between Ticket Prices & Seats Sold for Broadwayâ€™s The Lion King & Hamilton

This project uses a linear regression model to analyze the relationship between top and average ticket prices and the number of seats sold for the Broadway shows 'The Lion King' and 'Hamilton'. Results show that these variables are correlated, but do not explain what affects ticket prices. This suggests a need to explore other affecting variables."
