\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
A linear regression model is conducted to analyze the relationship between top and average ticket prices and the number of seats sold for the Broadway shows `The Lion King' and `Hamilton'. Results show that these variables are correlated, but do not explain what affects ticket prices. This suggests a need to explore other affecting variables.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

I am a modest musical fan. I know a good number of musicals thanks to Disney and my theater-fanatic friend from high school, Hadeel. My 2 favorite theatrical musicals are The Lion King and Hamilton. While browsing Alex Cookson's blog (Cookson, n.d.), his take on the most successful Broadway show of all time grabbed my attention. He analyzes box office returns to determine the highest-grossing show. Which got me wondering why are ticket prices set the way they are? How are ticket prices affected by seats sold?

This project builds on Alex's work by creating a multiple regression model to try to understand how ticket prices and seats sold for The Lion King and Hamilton are correlated. The linear regression model should quantify the strength of the relationship between the ticket price and the seats sold. If a relationship is found, it could help forecast future ticket prices.

Two models are run, one with the top ticket price as the dependent (response) variable, and another with the average ticket price as the dependent variable. It was found that top ticket price, average ticket price and the number of seats sold are correlated. The results, however, do not suggest that these variables can predict or explain ticket prices.

The \protect\hyperlink{Mux5cux26D}{Method and Data} section will give information about the dataset and some exploratory analysis. The \protect\hyperlink{model}{Model} section will cover how the multiple linear regression was conducted, and the \protect\hyperlink{results}{Results} section will report the results of the model. The \protect\hyperlink{discusssion}{Discussion} section will discuss the implications of the results, and the limitations of the model.

\section{Ethical Considerations}\label{ethical-considerations}}

While I believe that what was done with The Lion King franchise is phenomenal, I feel responsible to give a nod to Osamu Tezuka's anime series `Kimba the White Lion' (1965) and the `Jungle Emperor' (1950) manga, whose work influenced The Lion King, despite the controversy. There is plenty of information about the controversy online, but I think Pete Keely wrote an encompassing summary on the issue on \href{https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lion-king-kimba-white-lion-does-disney-need-come-clean-1225822}{\emph{The Hollywood Reporter}} (Keeley 2020).

\section{Method and Data: \{\#M\&D\}}\label{method-and-data-md}}

\hypertarget{method}{%
\subsection{Method:}\label{method}}

The data will be analyzed using \texttt{R} (R Core Team 2020), a statistical programming language, and packages that allow easier data manipulation, like: \texttt{tidyverse} (Wickham et al. 2019), \texttt{lubridate} (Grolemund and Wickham 2011), \texttt{knitr} (Xie 2021), and \texttt{rsample}. Tables will be formatted using \texttt{KableExtra} (Hao Zhu ORCID iD {[}aut 2021) and \texttt{huxtable} (David Hugh-Jones {[}aut 2021). Data will be visualized using the \texttt{tidymodels} package (Wickham et al. 2019) that includes \texttt{ggplot2} package (Wickham 2016).

The multiple linear regression model will compare the correlation between top\_ticket, avg\_ticket and seats\_sold variables for The Lion King and Hamilton. Top ticket and average ticket prices will alternate as dependent (response) variables in the model.

The code for visualizing confidence intervals was taken from \texttt{rsample}'s website (``Bootstrap Confidence Intervals,'' n.d.).

\hypertarget{dataset-description}{%
\subsection{Dataset description:}\label{dataset-description}}

The dataset includes information about many Broadway shows from the very first week they started showing in theaters on Broadway, New York until the latest performance in March 2020, as all shows were stopped around that time because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset includes information like the number of weeks the show has been running, the overall gross, the theater the show was performed at, the number of seats sold, average and top ticket prices, etc. The information has been scraped off of the Playbill website, which uses data from The Broadway League's official website. The Broadway League is the official entity that oversees all theatrical shows on Broadway.

The original dataset contains 47,524 observations and 14 variables. Since the scope of the project will be on The Lion King and Hamilton shows only, the dataset has been filtered and now has 1,407 observations with 3 N/A values and 14 variables. Here's a preview of how it looks like:

\begin{table}

\subsection{Variables used in the model:}\label{variables-used-in-the-model}}

The variables that will be analyzed are as follows. Variable descriptions are imported from Alex's repo (Cookson, n.d.):

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccc@{}}
\toprule
variable & class & description\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
show & character & Name of the show, i.e.~The `Lion King' and `Hamilton'\tabularnewline
avg\_ticket\_price & double & Average price of tickets sold\tabularnewline
top\_ticket\_price & double & Highest price of tickets sold\tabularnewline
seats\_sold & double & Total seats sold for all performances and previews\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

The only change made to a variable is the data-type for `show'; it is changed from `character' to `factor' as it contains binary data. This change is necessary for the model to recognize categorical variables.

\hypertarget{data-exploration}{%
\subsection{Data Exploration}\label{data-exploration}}

The Lion King is considered to be one of the longest and most successful Broadway shows in history (Desk 2019). It has been running since October 1997 (over 20 years) and grossed over \$1.6 billion in performances on Broadway alone (not counting performances done on tour). Hamilton, on the other hand, first debuted in October 2015 but has gained much success. In fact, in the 6 years of running, Hamilton grossed over \$600 million. That is equivalent to what The Lion King made in about 12 years. Figure @ref{[}fig:grosses{]} exhibits the grosses of both shows over the years:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{paper_files/figure-latex/grosses-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:grosses}Grosses over the years}
\end{figure}

\newpage

Figure \ref{fig:performances} exhibits that both shows maintained 8 performances per week most of the time:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{paper_files/figure-latex/performances-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:performances}Performances per week}
\end{figure}

\newpage

As shown in figure \ref{fig:aveticketsvsseatssold}, Hamilton consistently sold 10,000 seats per week at average ticket price, and The Lion King sold between 13 - 15 thousand seats:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{paper_files/figure-latex/aveticketsvsseatssold-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:aveticketsvsseatssold}Seats sold per week versus average ticket prices}
\end{figure}

\newpage

So the number of seats sold for Hamilton is less than The Lion King's, but what about the theater's capacity?

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{paper_files/figure-latex/aveticketsvspctcapacity-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:aveticketsvspctcapacity}Percentage of theater capacity sold versus average ticket price}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:aveticketsvspctcapacity} shows that when the average ticket price for The Lion King was between about \$50 - \$200, the theater was at 100\% capacity, meaning it sold out. The demand for Hamilton was stronger; average tickets sold out when they ranged between \$150 - \$350. Some shows even had over 100\% capacity. These are instances of standing room tickets.

\newpage

Time to explore the ticket prices.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{paper_files/figure-latex/aveticketprice-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:aveticketprice}Average ticket prices each week}
\end{figure}

It is evident in figure \ref{fig:aveticketprice} that Hamilton tickets are way more expensive than The Lion King's. Hamilton may have started close to the lowest ticket price of The Lion King in 2015, but the average ticket price for Hamilton doubled within the first year and exceeded The Lion King's within the second year. While the average ticket price for The Lion King could reach up to a maximum of \$200, Hamilton's \emph{started} at \$250.

\newpage

Similarly, the top ticket price for Hamilton starts at the maximum of The Lion King's tickets. It is almost double the price. Figure \ref{fig:topticketprice} shows the top ticket price trend:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{paper_files/figure-latex/topticketprice-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:topticketprice}Top ticket prices per week}
\end{figure}

\newpage

To put things into perspective, figure \ref{fig:aveticketsvstopticketpricebyyears} compares top ticket price versus average ticket price for both shows over the years. The Lion King's ticket prices had incremental increases in the last 5 years. However, Hamilton's ticket prices grew exponentially over the first 2 years, and gradually for the remaining years.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{paper_files/figure-latex/aveticketsvstopticketpricebyyears-1.pdf}
\caption{\label{fig:aveticketsvstopticketpricebyyears}Top ticket prices versus average ticket prices per year}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{model}{%
\section{Model}\label{model}}

Linear regression is one of the statistical analysis tools that shows the relationship between two or more variables. It uses data to predict trends. As mentioned earlier, the linear regression model is used to quantify the strength of the relationship between the ticket prices and the seats sold. It can also help forecast future ticket prices.

\hypertarget{alternative-models}{%
\subsection{Alternative Models}\label{alternative-models}}

An Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model could be also used to understand current data and forecast future ticket prices. It relies on historical data to make predictions. I would have loved to have conducted both multiple linear regression and ARIMA and compared the results, but ARIMA uses time-series data and that is beyond my humble expertise in R. I tried.

\hypertarget{model-specifics}{%
\subsection{Model Specifics}\label{model-specifics}}

Two regression models will be created; one uses the top ticket price as the dependent variable, and the other uses the average ticket price. To distinguish between both models, the top ticket price model will be referred to as the top\_model, and the average ticket price model will be referred to as avg\_model.

\textbf{Top\_model specifics:}
- Dependent variable: Top ticket price
- Independent variables: Average ticket price, seats sold, show
- Mathematical notation:
\[
Top Ticket Price = Intercept (b) + m (average ticket price) + m (seats sold) + m (show) + residual error
\]

\textbf{Avg\_model specifics:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Dependent variable: Average ticket price
\item
  Independent variables: Top ticket price, seats sold, show
\item
  Mathematical notation:
  \[
  Average Ticket Price = Intercept (b) + m (top ticket price) + m (seats sold) + m (show) + residual error
  \]
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{hypothesis}{%
\subsection{Hypothesis}\label{hypothesis}}

\textbf{H0:} There is no statistically significant relationship between ticket prices and seats sold at a show

\textbf{H1:} There is a statistically significant relationship between ticket prices and seats sold at a show

\[
Top Ticket Price = 308.31 + 1.7 (average ticket price) - 0.02 (seats sold) + 223.81 (show) + 64.56 
\]

The results show that there is a statistically significant relationship between the top ticket price and seats sold at a show. Therefore the null hypothesis is rejected.

\[
Average Ticket Price = -40.78 +0.32 (top ticket price) + 0.007 (seats sold) -11.92 (show) + 27.49
\]

The results show that there is a statistically significant relationship between the top ticket price and seats sold at a show. Therefore the null hypothesis is rejected.

Although comparing ticket prices between The Lion King and Hamilton quantified the price differences between the shows, this comparison was not useful in \emph{predicting} ticket prices. For example, the model suggests that for each seat sold for The Lion King, the average ticket price is expected to increase by an average of \$0.007. Does that mean that if 2 seats are sold that the average ticket price will increase by \$0.014? Or if a 1,000 seats sold that the average ticket price will increase by \$7? No.~Although these variables are correlated, it is not a case of causality.

There are other factors that affect ticket prices that this model did not capture. Take the season, for example. Holidays are known to attract more traffic, hence the number of tickets and seats sold is expected to increase.

\hypertarget{weaknesses}{%
\subsection{Weaknesses}\label{weaknesses}}

The avg model's confidence interval for `show - Hamilton' variable is not significant as a portion of the residuals were equal to zero. This could be caused by outlier data points. This also caused an error in the model's result that the average ticket price for Hamilton is \$11.92 dollars cheaper The Lion King's. It should be investigated further to fix that error.

\hypertarget{next-steps}{%
\subsection{Next Steps}\label{next-steps}}

It would be interesting to conduct a multiple regression model with different dependent variables to see how they correlate with ticket prices and number of seats sold, for example:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Weekly grosses
\item
  Awards received, like Tony Awards
\end{itemize}

It would also be interesting to conduct an ARIMA model to forecast if and when Hamilton's grosses will exceed The Lion King's.
